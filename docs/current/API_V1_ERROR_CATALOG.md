# API v1 — error catalog

Every `/api/v1` response uses the envelope `{ data, meta, errors }`. On any
non-2xx, `data` is `null` and `errors` is a non-empty array of
`{ code, message, field? }`. This table is authoritative for the stable
`code` values. **Any new `/api/v1` route MUST add its error codes here (and
to [`docs/openapi.yaml`](../openapi.yaml)) in the same PR.**

## Conventions

- `code` is uppercase snake_case, stable across versions.
- `message` is human-readable and may change freely.
- `field` is set only for `VALIDATION_ERROR` on body validation failures.
- `meta.requestId` is always present; include it when reporting issues.
