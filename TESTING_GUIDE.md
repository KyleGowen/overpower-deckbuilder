# Overpower Deckbuilder Testing Guide

## 🚀 Jest Integration Test Framework Setup Complete!

Your project now has a comprehensive Jest testing framework set up with the following features:

### ✅ What's Included

1. **Jest Configuration** (`jest.config.js`)
   - TypeScript support with ts-jest
   - Test environment setup
   - Coverage reporting
   - Separate test database

2. **Test Structure**
   ```
   tests/
   ├── integration/          # Full API workflow tests
   ├── unit/                 # Individual function tests
   ├── helpers/              # Test utilities (ApiClient)
   ├── config/               # Test configuration
   └── setup.ts             # Global setup/teardown
   ```

3. **Test Scripts** (in package.json)
   - `npm test` - Run all tests
   - `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
   - `npm run test:coverage` - Run with coverage report
   - `npm run test:integration` - Run only integration tests
   - `npm run test:unit` - Run only unit tests

4. **Sample Tests Created**
   - Authentication scenarios
   - Deck management workflows
   - Read-only mode functionality

### 🧪 How to Use

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test deckManagement.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

#### Writing New Tests

**For Integration Tests:**
```typescript
describe('Your Feature', () => {
  let apiClient: ApiClient;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    apiClient = new ApiClient(app);
    await apiClient.login('username', 'password');
  });
  
  it('should do something', async () => {
    const response = await apiClient.createDeck({ name: 'Test Deck' });
    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

**For Unit Tests:**
```typescript
import { validateDeck } from '../../src/utils/deckValidation';

describe('Deck Validation', () => {
  it('should validate a legal deck', () => {
    const deck = [/* test data */];
    const result = validateDeck(deck);
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### 📝 Describing Test Scenarios

When you want me to write tests for specific scenarios, just describe them like this:

**Example 1:**
> "I want to test the deck sharing functionality. When a user shares a deck link with another user, that user should be able to view the deck in read-only mode. The viewer should see all deck contents but not be able to edit them. Also test what happens if the deck doesn't exist or if the user isn't logged in."

**Example 2:**
> "Test the card search functionality. When a user types in the search bar, it should find cards by name, type, and character. Test that special cards show up when searching for a character name. Also test the hover effects and the scrollbar visibility."

**Example 3:**
> "Test the save functionality. When a user makes changes to their deck and clicks save, it should persist the changes. Test that validation errors are shown for invalid decks. Test that the save button is disabled in read-only mode."

### 🔧 Test Configuration

The tests use a separate test database (`overpower_test`) to avoid affecting your development data. The test database is automatically:
- Created before tests run
- Migrated with your schema
- Cleaned up after tests complete

### 🎯 Current Test Status

✅ **All tests passing** (24/24)
- Authentication tests: 7 scenarios
- Deck management tests: 6 scenarios  
- Read-only mode tests: 11 scenarios

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Uncomment the actual API calls** in the test files when you're ready to test against your real application
2. **Add your app import** to the test files: `import app from '../../src/index';`
3. **Describe specific scenarios** you want me to write tests for
4. **Run tests regularly** as you develop new features

### 💡 Pro Tips

- Use `npm run test:watch` during development for instant feedback
- Check `coverage/` folder for detailed coverage reports
- Use `console.log()` in tests for debugging
- Tests run in isolation - each test gets a clean database state
- Use the `ApiClient` helper for consistent API testing

**Ready to test!** 🎉 Just describe any scenario you want tested and I'll write comprehensive tests for it!
