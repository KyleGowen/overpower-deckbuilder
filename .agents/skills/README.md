# Excelsior Codex Skills

Repo-local Codex skills live here. They are the project source of truth for recurring Excelsior workflows; do not maintain a separate Cursor/global mirror.

Skipped by choice:

| Cursor skill | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| `add-community-deck` | Not needed in Codex project workflow |
| `add-tournament-deck` | Not needed in Codex project workflow |
| Cursor product skills except possible future workflows | Cursor-specific or not currently needed |

Migration conventions:

- Keep skill names lowercase and hyphenated.
- Each skill must have `SKILL.md`; add `agents/openai.yaml` for user-facing display metadata.
- Prefer bundled scripts for deterministic or fragile workflows.
- Adapt Cursor-only concepts to Codex-native behavior: use parallel tool calls instead of Cursor Task subagents, and use local browser/API verification instead of Cursor IDE browser MCP.
- Keep links relative to the skill folder, usually `../../../` back to the repo root.
