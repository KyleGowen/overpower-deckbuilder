# Add Cards Panel

Feature context for [`AddCardsPanel.tsx`](AddCardsPanel.tsx), the deck-editor drawer used to browse and add catalog cards to the current deck.

## UX Goals

- Make it easier to build a deck without relying on memory of card text or character stats.
- Keep card images large enough to inspect at normal laptop zoom.
- Preserve the user’s working context while they compare cards, switch tabs, close/reopen the drawer, and adjust quantities.
- Keep the right-side card grid fast for adding cards; use hover/context panes for inspection instead of changing click behavior.

## Desktop Context Pane

On desktop viewports wider than 1200px, the Add Cards drawer uses a contextual pane beside the results grid. Below 1200px, preserve the single-pane flow.

- Team summary rows should show up to four character slots. Filled rows show character name plus readable generated stat badges for Energy, Combat, Brute Force, Intelligence, and Threat Value. Empty rows use subtle placeholders. A deck should never show more than four character rows.
- Stat icons must be readable on a laptop without browser zoom. If there is spare space in the row, use it for icon size and spacing before adding decoration.
- The fourth character row should visually match rows 1-3, including its divider, with clear buffer before the filter area.
- Hovering a team row previews the selected printing/art for that character in the preview area.

## Filters

- Filters are dynamic to the active Add Cards tab and should hide impossible options.
- Do not show MP for Training cards when no MP Training cards exist.
- Location filters should include Threat Value and may give that control slightly more room since it is often the only location-specific numeric filter.
- Character numeric filters should fit in two rows in the context pane. Do not allow them to overlap the preview image or require horizontal scrolling.
- Special card filters should place Type on row 1 and Function on row 2, left-aligned with stable label/control columns.
- Use selected control states plus a nearby Clear action. Do not add active filter pills that restate the visible selections.
- Filter state should persist while the user remains in the same deck-editor session: closing/reopening Add Cards and switching tabs should restore search, active tab, set, hide-unusable, page/quantity state, and type-specific dynamic filters. Resetting on deck-editor exit or deck change is acceptable.

## Hover Preview

- The hover preview area should be image-only. Do not include details, text blocks, or buttons that reduce available image space.
- Placeholder text should stay minimal: `Hover for full image.`
- Hovering a card in the results grid or a filled team row should show the full card image scaled to fit the preview area.
- Clicking a result card still adds it. Hover preview should remain on the last hovered card after add and clear only when hovering off the card/team row.

## Verification

For Add Cards UI changes, verify with browser screenshots at a laptop-sized desktop viewport and a wider desktop viewport.

Check:

- Stat icons are readable.
- Filters wrap inside the context pane without overlap or horizontal scroll.
- Section dividers have breathing room around character rows and filters.
- Vertical cards use the available preview area well.
- Close/reopen and tab switching preserve filters and quantity/page state within the deck edit session.
